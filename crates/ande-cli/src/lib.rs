//! # ANDE CLI
//!
//! **Status: STUB CRATE - Not yet implemented**
//!
//! This crate will provide the command-line interface for ANDE Chain operations.
//!
//! ## Planned Features
//!
//! - Node management commands (start, stop, status)
//! - Account management (create, import, export keys)
//! - Transaction submission
//! - Query commands (balances, blocks, transactions)
//! - Staking operations
//! - Configuration management
//!
//! ## Current Implementation
//!
//! This crate is a placeholder. The actual CLI is currently integrated into
//! the `ande-reth` binary which uses Reth's CLI infrastructure.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! For production use, run the ande-reth binary:
//!
//! ```bash
//! ./target/release/ande-reth node --chain specs/genesis.json
//! ```
//!
//! ## Future Development
//!
//! This crate may be developed to provide a standalone CLI tool for:
//! - DevOps automation scripts
//! - Integration with deployment pipelines
//! - Simplified user interaction for non-node operations
